# Notes for AWS re /Strat traning, 19th october
----
``````
1. Downloaded and  used Git Bash in order to creat a local repository.
Learned how to push the local file to the cloud via 3 methods,GUI,VS code and the command line from within Linux/VSCode
2. Explored modules & libraries
3. Using python to prepare and analyse insulin. Used pyhone to automate the removal of unnesessary characters from text.

## Labs 11 to 14

## Lab 11: Working with the String Sequence and Numeric Weight of Insulin in Python
``````
1.Add comments that explain the intention and flow of your code
2.Use print() to print elements of your Python code to the console
3.Use string manipulations to get the sequence of insulin from preproinsulin
4.Do basic math on the molecular weight and sequence of insulin
5.Assign string, int, and float variables to numbers that represent the weight of insulin
Explore Python exceptions
``````



## Lab 12:Calculating the Net Charge of Insulin by Using Python Lists and Loops
``````
1.Create a dictionary of pKa values (which indicate the strength of an acid) that will be used in the net charge calculations
2.Use the count() method to get a count of amino acids
3.Use a while loop to calculate the net charge of insulin from pH 0 to pH 14
``````

## lab 13: Using Functions to Implement a Caesar Cipher

`````
1.The lab centers around implementing a Caesar cipher, a straightforward encryption technique that shifts each letter in a message by a set number of positions in the alphabet.
2.Interaction with the user occurs via the input() function to obtain messages and cipher keys, with subsequent output of the encrypted and decrypted messages.
``````
## lab 14: Creating File Handlers and Modules for Retrieving Information about Insulin


``````note
1.Lab 14:  The JSON module in Python facilitates the handling of JSON data, which is commonly used for storing and exchanging structured data.
2.Reading and parsing JSON data involves using the json.load() method, which converts JSON data into a Python dictionary.
3.Effective error handling, such as using try-except blocks, can prevent program crashes when dealing with file operations.
